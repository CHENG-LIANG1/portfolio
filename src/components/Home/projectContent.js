      Monash University, a renowned institution with six branches and a rich history, seeks to connect with its youthful student demographic. The goal is to craft a motion graphic video that embodies Monash's brand identity and resonates with young, energetic students.
      <br/><br/>Objectives:<br/><br/>
      - Create a motion graphic video that embodies Monash University's brand identity.<br/>
      - Design engaging and informative elements that appeal to the youthful target audience.<br/>
      - Visually showcase one of Monash University's four branches (each group selects one).<br/>
      - Elevate the viewer's experience through motion graphic elements.<br/>
      - Collaborate with the library client, establish a design strategy, and meet set goals and deadlines effectively throughout the design process.

    <div className={'project-paragraph'}>
      <div className={'heading'}>Challenges</div>
      The primary challenge in this project was aligning the graphic animation's style with Monash University's established brand image. The issue stemmed from the fact that Monash's design specifications manual primarily focused on web design, offering limited guidance for video. The typeface was for web hierarchy, and the colour references used RGB codes mode. Therefore, it's essential to have direct communication with the client to establish a flexible colour palette (lightness, gradients, purity) and adaptable font hierarchies.
      <br/> <br/>Filming posed additional challenges, particularly when capturing specific areas within the Matheson Library. Some spaces were open to the public but required booking and filming permissions, making subplot creation and storyboarding more complex. This often-entailed multiple rounds of filming. Privacy concerns also arose when filming characters.
      <br/> <br/>Lastly, conducting outdoor audio recordings was complicated due to susceptibility to ambient noise.

    <div className={'project-paragraph'}>
      Given Matheson Library's unique and differentiated facilities, our video presentation should expand beyond its traditional roles of renting and researching. It should prominently feature the library's distinctive exhibition content, showcasing the extra effort invested by Monash University in building this resource.
      The SPECIAL COLLECTION, GALLERY, LISTENING ROOM, and KULATA TJUTA areas house a vast array of artifacts from around the world. Consequently, we can envision Sir Louis Matheson Library as a diverse hub of learning, extending beyond the realms of study and research.
      <br/> <br/>
      In the screenplay, it's crucial to strategize how to incorporate these settings and effectively convey the user experience.

      There are four types of visual assets: kinetic typography, lower-third illustration, path trim animation, and 3D camera tracking. These designs constitute the core creative content of our video, as outlined in the storyboard introduction. They serve to introduce various interior scenes and guide the visual narrative.
      <br/> <br/>
      Production Process: Kinetic Typography, Path Trim, and Tracking Animations: These were created in Adobe After Effects (AE) and involved some filming with our team members.
      <br/> <br/>
      Lower-Third Illustration: To maintain consistency in typeface, we electronically crafted lower-third illustrations in Photoshop. The style of these illustrations echoes the vintage illustrations found within the interior pages of the SPECIAL COLLECTION. This design choice not only reflects the gallery's history but also alludes to the extensive collection of rare and antiquated books within the library.

      As previously mentioned, we encountered challenges with colour specifications during the early stages of the project.

      <br/> <br/>
      Ultimately, we decided on Monash's classic black and white as our primary colour scheme, with Ruby Pink as a complementary secondary colour for the Matheson Library branch. (Accept brightness change).
      <br/> <br/>
      We opted for the Roboto regular typeface, deviating from the condensed style outlined in the Monash Design Manual （This deviation was approved after seeking permission.）

    <div className={'project-paragraph'}>
      Our project represented an intriguing blend of photography and graphic animation, pushing the boundaries of creativity. We encountered several challenges, particularly in our choice of colours and fonts. This stemmed from the necessity to align with the client brief, ensuring alignment with the MONASH brand guidelines (the web design guidelines couldn't directly apply to the video production.
      <br/> <br/>
      To overcome these challenges, we are engaged in extensive communication with both library teams and mentors. This collaborative effort allowed us to recreate the font hierarchy tailored for the video and fine-tune the Title Sequence colour palette, ensuring it remained consistent with the MONASH brand.
      <br/> <br/>
      Moreover, our filming environment posed limitations on our ADR voiceover. In hindsight, we acknowledge that further adjustments in post-production, such as Recording Studio recording, could have enhanced audio fidelity. This learning experience underscores the importance of meticulous post-production refinement to elevate the overall project quality.

      The primary challenge during this project was the rigging manipulation of the animal movement. This demanded meticulous reference to the real-world motion patterns of a Tasmanian Devil or a similar reptilian species. The intricate aspect was harmonizing these authentic animal movements with the environmental graphics. Notably, both components, the animal's motion and the environment should be separately illustrated while adhering to a unified stylistic consistency (For AR purposes). This delicate balancing act was essential for creating a visually compelling narrative.

  <div className={'paragraph-container'}>
    <div className={'project-paragraph'}>
      The survival of Tasmanian Devils is seriously threatened by Devil Facial Tumour Disease which develops rapidly and is fatal. <br />
      Once the highly infectious cancerous tumours appear around the mouth, face and neck, the Devils generally die within three to six months. <br />
      The other threat is cars (and their drivers) killing them on the roads. <br />
      <br /> <br />
      Zoos Victoria, through Healesville Sanctuary, is a partner of the Save the Tasmanian Devil program. It aims to breed and manage up to 50 Devils as part of the long-term insurance program. In 2013, 2015 and 2017, Tasmanian Devils were released from Healesville to locations free of the tumour disease on Maria Island and the Tasman Peninsula. Zoos Victoria also assists with monitoring animals and conducting research in the wild, in the lab and in the captive program.

      The animal character design for the Tasmanian Devil adopts a vector-based cartoon drawing style. The character's actions include crawling, running, and resting, which were meticulously illustrated as separate entities, each aligned with the predefined scenes in the storyboard. These scenes encompassed various aspects of the Tasmanian Devil's life, such as predation, facial expressions, and its habitat.
      <br /> <br />
      For perspective considerations, I experimented with turning the character's head, thus creating diverse perspectives for the depicted actions. This approach aimed to enhance the visual appeal and storytelling capacity of the animal throughout the animation.

    <div className={'project-paragraph'}>
      The mood board primarily serves as a reference point for composition, a crucial element in our animated project, given the substantial interaction between the characters and their environment. During the mood board creation, we drew inspiration from several frames featuring a paper cutout style and a captivating parallax effect. This aesthetic direction significantly influenced our animation approach.
      <br /> <br />
      Ultimately, we adopted a method where each animal character is treated as a distinct foreground element while the background serves as the backdrop. We carefully calibrated the camera's depth of field and relative motion to achieve the desired visual effect. Furthermore, we drew insights from various material references to inform the overall design and atmosphere of the animation.

  </div>

  <div className={'paragraph-container'}>
    <div className={'project-paragraph'}>
      Secondary Animation: Tasmanian Devil's walking/running animation applies secondary movements of the body. When its inward-facing front leg is raised, another outward-facing leg will also lift. On top of this, the head will be shaking with the tail cocking and drooping. Similar use of this role has applied to another character's head-up animation. When the Tasmanian Devil's head is up, the eyes also move up. This provides a real focus and the direction of vision.
      <br /> <br />
      Anticipation: The head-up action is an anticipation action for shot switching. When the Tasmanian Devil looks at the sky, the camera is gradually pulled upward. The sky over the forest becomes the background of the next shot.
      <br /> <br />
      Arc: The magnifying glass animation uses a spiral arc motion path, which makes the Tasmanian Devil's gradient appearance animation more dynamic.

        “What is really strong in this submission is the use of motion so you've got really nice use of motion and transitions and cameras and movements so you know in the shadows as well. Yeah, just the transition the movement into the section about the Facial Tumor diseases and then you know that transition into the car is really strong and then into the sort of circle holding it. I think there's lots of really interesting ideas around motion and animation here that work really well. What's probably less strong is the design. So the devil character looks very different in the different shots. You know, the sort of simple versions of it at the start, and at the end, then, when it's endangered, you know, it's got the detail of its mouth. Then, yeah, there's sort of a start. It looks like a teddy bear. You've got a lot of different styles too. You've got the globe with Australia, then you've got sort of a really simple map and the simple pause, then the 3d trees, then the Facial Tumor section is very detailed. You know, then the kind of the leaves at the end sort of a different style again, with a drop shadow. So I really think just the visual design is where you need to concentrate your efforts and really start to take what's you know, clearly a good eye for motion graphics and for design generally and just apply that to the designs that you're creating and animating. Um, so yeah, that's probably the section where it's a little bit less strong. what I was saying was that I think, with the subtitles you should just use a simpler sans serif font rather than that kind of hand drawn font, which is generally sort of makes things look a little bit more childlike or a little less sophisticated. So yeah, I think there's really lots of strong elements here and you've created strong work throughout the semester. But there's also room in this submission for improvement. So I look forward to seeing what you do in subsequent semesters.”      </i>

The final sequence has discernible differences in the level of facial detail among the animal characters in close-up and angled shots. Moreover, while my scenes incorporated camera animations and textures, our choice of 2D binding meant that the animal assets lacked the textures necessary for a cohesive visual experience. This discordance highlighted the need for enhanced emphasis on aesthetic consistency in our future design endeavors.    </div>

      <div className={'heading'}>Challenges</div>
      One of the primary challenges we faced was the tight development cycle of the project. During the design phase of the Motion Graphic, the final product interface of the app had not yet been released. Consequently, we had to create separate graphic content to simulate the "to-be-released" interface of the app. This required meticulous attention to detail and a forward-thinking approach to ensure seamless integration with the final product.
      <br/> <br/>
      Moreover, Client A provided us with a two-minute-long voice-over content. To keep the audience constantly engaged, we should avoid content repetition or interruptions while introducing the interface and functions. In addition, we should align our visual element properly with the VO content. This intricate balance allowed us to effectively convey the app's new features while ensuring a smooth and cohesive viewing experience.    </div>

      The project presented a short-term Motion Graphic (MG) challenge, placing a premium on an effective production strategy. To meet the project's demands, I embarked on a journey of experimentation, particularly focusing on vector illustration MG techniques.

      The outdoor shooting experience for this project presented numerous challenges that pushed my filmmaking skills to the limit. In particular, finding an ideal location in Melbourne proved to be a daunting task. I settled on an isolated park to minimize disturbances, but even there, we couldn't entirely escape the sounds of nature, including persistent bird calls. Furthermore, the distant noise of passing trains and helicopters occasionally disrupted our audio recordings, necessitating multiple takes to ensure clarity.
      <br/> <br/>
      The project demanded meticulous attention to both lighting and framing simultaneously. Maintaining consistent lighting conditions was essential to convey a seamless sense of time within the frame. Simultaneously, I had to carefully position the interviewee to ensure the background remained consistent. Meeting all these outdoor requirements simultaneously was crucial for the shoot's success.
      <br/> <br/>
      Studio feedback highlighted some display glitches in the title font animation within the final cut, which I will address to enhance the project's visual quality. Additionally, adjustments in the soundtrack have been suggested, such as increasing the volume during the opening credits and reducing it beneath the human voice level during the interview segment. These enhancements will contribute to a more polished final product.

      In retrospect, the project's reverse shot design was a notable success. Given the constraints imposed by the pandemic, I faced limitations in terms of character identities and rituals to explore. I initially experimented with scenarios involving police or doctors, but the feasibility of these concepts was restricted due to limited access to suitable props and settings. Consequently, I opted for the idea of a race driver: Preparing for a match but eventually going out with a bicycle.
      <br /> <br />
      The central concept revolved around creating an elaborate setup for the character's morning preparations, only to reveal a surprisingly simple task as the ultimate goal, forming the basis for the reversal. Building on the constructive feedback received from peers, it's evident that certain aspects of the initial shots, particularly the out-of-focus elements in the foreground, could have been further refined. Additionally, selecting a cleaner background would have enhanced the viewer's focus on the character's movements.
      <br /> <br />
      Overall, the project offered valuable insights into the creative process, emphasizing the importance of thoughtful shot composition and background selection to deliver the visual narrative.

      The primary challenge encountered during the production phase was related to fine-tuning
      the path animation within the 3D modelling software. At the onset of production, there
      was a limited familiarity with 3D software tools, leading to several difficulties in seamlessly
      adjusting the analogue spline.<br /><br />
      This lack of experience resulted in the identification of multiple gaps and inconsistencies
      within the spline, requiring extensive troubleshooting and adjustments. This challenge
      underscored the importance of acquiring a more comprehensive understanding of 3D
      software and its intricacies for future projects.<br /><br />

  </div>
  <div className={'paragraph-container'}>
    <div className={'project-paragraph'}>
      The concept of Low Poly is a lightweight structural style that has been widely used in different
      digital fields. In terms of the technical modelling aspects, this structure reduces the time and
      cost of rendering to a certain extent. This is because Low Poly means the application of fewer
      surfaces. As a result, the geometric nature of its constituent elements is enhanced, which
      differs the Low Poly style from the traditional digital style that seeks realism. This is crucial
      because building elements using the Low Poly style means purposefully not making objects
      realistic. Therefore, when practising the Low Poly style of building Playset models, it is
      necessary to balance the abstraction with the realism. It is needed to consider the type of
      object (liquid-solid, malleable or not) and its materiality in the real world.

      use of glowing materials are trendy. The visually cool colour tones can emphasize the sense
      of futuristic technology. A small amount of doctored effect is used for metallic elements, which

      The 'floating island' model below the original modelling is removed as it is not suitable as a

      The overall colour palette is adjusted from the original cool colour scheme to the current
      warm colour scheme to make the overall emotional and thematic tone more appropriate for
      younger children. The new colour palette has a positive, cute and warm emotional tone. The
      background has changed from the old gradient background to a purer beige background
      using Octane Sky, which stimulates a realistic projection of objects. Spotlight lighting has been
      added to the lighting section to accentuate and enhance the sense of object volume. The

      The packaging design is in keeping with the overall colour palette of orange and white. By
      researching the existing toy packaging, most of the toy packaging is masked with a close-up

      schemes: a collage of dark and light colours as solid colour graphics. I was inspired by one of
      these examples and used rectangles as lines to connect the front back and sides of the
      packaging. In my final design, I made a combination of rectangular frames and rectangular
      fills for the basic design concept, with a rectangular mask to fix the size and dimensions of
      the rendered image's appearance.

      For this limited-edition shoe, Reebok is looking for a motif to adorn the footwear. The design
      should encapsulate the beauty and diversity of Australia and its people. <br/> <br/>
      Create a dynamic brand identity animation that breathes new life into the Reebok logo,
      gearing up for sales, marketing, and promotional activities in the lead-up to and during the
      Brisbane 2032 Olympics.<br/> <br/>
      A motion design that offers a fun and engaging experience, effectively promoting the
      brand while generating awareness for this distinctive shoe.<br/> <br/>

      The primary challenge in this project was selecting the right visual concept. I needed to
      find iconic elements that resonated with the city of Brisbane, catering to viewers from
      diverse cultural backgrounds, all in line with the Olympic program's goal of engaging a
      culturally diverse audience. An essential insight from studio activities was the importance
      of making the sneaker and its animation instantly recognizable: it is not just for Brisbane
      locals but also for audiences from other countries.<br/> <br/>
      On the technical side of production, our main challenge was ensuring consistency in
      stylization.<br/> <br/>

      The Brisbane 2032 Olympics will feature 28 sports and over 300 events. They'll be held in
      various venues, including those in Brisbane, Gold Coast, and Sunshine Coast. To support the
      events, governments are upgrading infrastructure, including iconic spots like the riverfront.
      This opens up possibilities for using areas around the Story Bridge for events like marathons.
      The Olympic theme design will consider these popular areas, rich in landmarks, culture, and
      biodiversity.

      I gathered the concepts of the Queenslander building and the Story Bridge through interviews
      with local Brisbane residents. Luckily, having lived in Brisbane for three years, I acquired these
      ideas through conversations with former landlords. <br /><br />
      Reebok's limited-edition design draws inspiration from Brisbane's unique local architecture,
      featuring the iconic Story Bridge and Queenslander houses. These sturdy structures symbolize
      Brisbane's identity and heritage. Reebok aims to raise awareness of the importance of
      preserving these historic relics. The design showcases the buildings' textures on the running
      shoe, connecting architectural heritage with the Olympic spirit. During the Games, Story
      Bridge and Queenslanders will become popular tourist attractions, promoting engagement
      with Brisbane's local culture.<br /><br />

      The logo animation concept involves using a roller to roll across the Story Bridge. As it rolls,
      the word 'REEBOK' is printed on the bridge, and it seamlessly matches with the previously
      drawn motif.

      The original concept focused on depicting a 'running' motion on the bridge. I attempted
      this using C4D animation, but it was challenging to realise the step-by-step movement. As
      a result, I used an alternative plan to design a separate fabric simulation-style screen for the
      middle section of the campaign. It served as an ambient setting, featuring key text messages
      like shoe textures, the Olympic rings, and 'Brisbane.' These elements match the shoe pattern's
      colours and enhance the overall Heritage Run collection design. <br/> <br/>
      During the process of split-screen design, the story bridge generation animation continued
      the screen setup from the logo animation for further refinement, which ensured consistency
      of stylistic elements.<br/> <br/>

      The need for independent shoe motif design placed significant demands on the video
      element's style. Ensuring stylistic consistency during the split-screen design process also
      required careful consideration of how to incorporate flat textures and models. I employed the
      bridge-type animation style throughout the dynamic design, using the generated Story
      Bridge animation to different extents in the logo animation and MG animation, highlighting
      the iconic nature of the Story Bridge. During the design process, I learned advanced UV
      mapping techniques for motif creation, which led to further refinement of light and material
      mapping in subsequent designs.
