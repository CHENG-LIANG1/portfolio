      Monash University, a renowned institution with six branches and a rich history, seeks to connect with its youthful student demographic. The goal is to craft a motion graphic video that embodies Monash's brand identity and resonates with young, energetic students.
      <br/><br/>Objectives:<br/><br/>
      - Create a motion graphic video that embodies Monash University's brand identity.<br/>
      - Design engaging and informative elements that appeal to the youthful target audience.<br/>
      - Visually showcase one of Monash University's four branches (each group selects one).<br/>
      - Elevate the viewer's experience through motion graphic elements.<br/>
      - Collaborate with the library client, establish a design strategy, and meet set goals and deadlines effectively throughout the design process.

      <div className={'heading'}>Challenges</div>
      The primary challenge in this project was aligning the graphic animation's style with Monash University's established brand image. The issue stemmed from the fact that Monash's design specifications manual primarily focused on web design, offering limited guidance for video. The typeface was for web hierarchy, and the colour references used RGB codes mode. Therefore, it's essential to have direct communication with the client to establish a flexible colour palette (lightness, gradients, purity) and adaptable font hierarchies.
      <br/> <br/>Filming posed additional challenges, particularly when capturing specific areas within the Matheson Library. Some spaces were open to the public but required booking and filming permissions, making subplot creation and storyboarding more complex. This often-entailed multiple rounds of filming. Privacy concerns also arose when filming characters.
      <br/> <br/>Lastly, conducting outdoor audio recordings was complicated due to susceptibility to ambient noise.

  </div>
  <div className={'paragraph-container'}>
    <div className={'project-paragraph'}>
      The Sir Louis Matheson Library, situated at 40 Exhibition Walk on the Monash Clayton campus, is one of Monash University's branch libraries. In 2017, the library underwent a significant redesign by COX Architecture.
      <br/> <br/>
      This library boasts an extensive collection of books, journals, and media materials. Beyond its role in providing specialized study and research support, it houses a unique assortment of rare books and original recordings, along with artifacts from indigenous cultures. The library is accessible to both members of the Monash University community and the general public.

  <div className={'paragraph-container'}>
    <div className={'project-paragraph'}>
      Given Matheson Library's unique and differentiated facilities, our video presentation should expand beyond its traditional roles of renting and researching. It should prominently feature the library's distinctive exhibition content, showcasing the extra effort invested by Monash University in building this resource.
      The SPECIAL COLLECTION, GALLERY, LISTENING ROOM, and KULATA TJUTA areas house a vast array of artifacts from around the world. Consequently, we can envision Sir Louis Matheson Library as a diverse hub of learning, extending beyond the realms of study and research.
      <br/> <br/>
      In the screenplay, it's crucial to strategize how to incorporate these settings and effectively convey the user experience.

      The story follows our protagonist engrossed in reading a book within the study room, symbolizing Sir Louis Matheson Library. As the character delves deeper into the text, they are brought into the library through the transition effect.
      <br/> <br/>
      Inside the library, the character encounters a fellow student, they together explore the Multimedia and Asian Collections area on the same floor. Spotting a card, they go to the gallery and read Sir John Monash's inscribed note, accompanied by their classmate.
      <br/> <br/>
      The next scene is the music room, the protagonist plays a CD and enjoys the melodies. They then visit the Special Collections section, carefully browse the rare books.
      <br/> <br/>
      The journey concludes as the character joins classmates in the study room, sharing their design experiences. The scene gracefully ascends towards the sky, marking the end of this enchanting tale.

  <div className={'paragraph-container'}>
    <div className={'project-paragraph'}>
      There are four types of visual assets: kinetic typography, lower-third illustration, path trim animation, and 3D camera tracking. These designs constitute the core creative content of our video, as outlined in the storyboard introduction. They serve to introduce various interior scenes and guide the visual narrative.
      <br/> <br/>
      Production Process: Kinetic Typography, Path Trim, and Tracking Animations: These were created in Adobe After Effects (AE) and involved some filming with our team members.
      <br/> <br/>
      Lower-Third Illustration: To maintain consistency in typeface, we electronically crafted lower-third illustrations in Photoshop. The style of these illustrations echoes the vintage illustrations found within the interior pages of the SPECIAL COLLECTION. This design choice not only reflects the gallery's history but also alludes to the extensive collection of rare and antiquated books within the library.

  </div>
  <div className={'paragraph-container'}>
    <div className={'project-paragraph'}>
      As previously mentioned, we encountered challenges with colour specifications during the early stages of the project. The initially proposed Aqua colour scheme, featured in the DEMO version, was rejected so we contacted our tutor and the library team a third time to ensure a precise range for the use of colours.
      <br/> <br/>
      Ultimately, we decided on Monash's classic black and white as our primary colour scheme, with Ruby Pink as a complementary secondary colour for the Matheson Library branch. (Accept brightness change).
      <br/> <br/>
      We opted for the Roboto regular typeface, deviating from the condensed style outlined in the Monash Design Manual （This deviation was approved after seeking permission.）

        “Great job! The documentation is well-designed, and the final resolved outcome is great to watch. To enhance it further, consider synchronising the sound and voice-over with certain clips, and improving the smoothness and thinness of lines paying more attention details in motion effects like the outline character.”

  </div>
  <div className={'paragraph-container'}>
    <div className={'project-paragraph'}>
      Our project represented an intriguing blend of photography and graphic animation, pushing the boundaries of creativity. We encountered several challenges, particularly in our choice of colours and fonts. This stemmed from the necessity to align with the client brief, ensuring alignment with the MONASH brand guidelines (the web design guidelines couldn't directly apply to the video production.
      <br/> <br/>
      To overcome these challenges, we are engaged in extensive communication with both library teams and mentors. This collaborative effort allowed us to recreate the font hierarchy tailored for the video and fine-tune the Title Sequence colour palette, ensuring it remained consistent with the MONASH brand.
      <br/> <br/>
      Moreover, our filming environment posed limitations on our ADR voiceover. In hindsight, we acknowledge that further adjustments in post-production, such as Recording Studio recording, could have enhanced audio fidelity. This learning experience underscores the importance of meticulous post-production refinement to elevate the overall project quality.
